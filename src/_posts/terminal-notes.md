# Terminal Notes

This is a short test post to verify markdown rendering, code highlighting, and list styles.

## Checklist

- Keep typography readable
- Embrace command-style headings
- Use restrained color accents

## Sample Code

```ts
export function prompt(user: string) {
  return `~$ hello ${user}`;
}
```

> Tip: Keep the UI consistent and avoid too many competing accents.
